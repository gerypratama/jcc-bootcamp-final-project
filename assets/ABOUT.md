# Greetings, Earthlings!

## So, what is this all about?

This simple yet abstract mobile app is merely an effort of the developer to finish the JCC Flutter Bootcamp well. The developer actually tried to build another profesional-looking kind of app at first, intended to integrate a job finder API. The developer thought it would be easier to just continue from his previous mockup assignment instead of building another one from scratch, and that the API integration process would be a walk in the park.

**And oh boy he hasn't ever been so wrong**

Long story short, after days of development of the intended app and less then 36 hours before the assignment deadline, the developer eventually decided to just "Screw it! and voila! EngIngApp was born.

*It's still has a lot of tweaks to do though but the basic required specs/functionality works fine.*

*Right...?*
